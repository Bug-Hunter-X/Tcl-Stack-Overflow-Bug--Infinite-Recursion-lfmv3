This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: stack overflow due to infinite recursion. The `bug.tcl` file contains a procedure that recursively calls itself without a proper termination condition.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version with a proper base case to prevent the stack overflow. This example highlights the importance of carefully designing recursive functions to avoid exceeding the call stack limit.
